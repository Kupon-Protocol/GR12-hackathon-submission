# Kupon Protocol - Submission For Gitcoin GR12 Hackathon

### About 

Kupon Protocol allows users to create NFTs that serve as coupons or vouchers.

### Examples

- A company can create a limited supply NFT that represents a 20% discount on a specific product.
- An influencer can offer paid NFTs that allow each holder to schedule a 30-min video chat with the influencer.
- A tutor can issue paid NFTs that represent tutoring time slots.

The Kupon Protocol also allows NFT holders and issuers to manage the process of claiming the offer that an NFT holds (for example a 30-min video call) and completing the claim after the service or product is provided.
